# What Is SAP Credential Store?

Store and retrieve credentials such as passwords, keys and keyrings. 

SAP Credential Store service provides a repository for passwords, keys and keyrings for applications that are running on SAP BTP. It enables the applications to retrieve credentials and use them for authentication to external services, or to perform cryptographic operations and TLS communication. SAP Credential Store is exposed to the applications via a REST API.

## Key Benefits of the Service

-   With SAP Credential Store you can:

-   Create, store and manage cryptographic credentials, which your SAP BTP applications can use to access external services

-   Provide higher level of security by using multi-version cryptographic keys to encrypt or decrypt other cryptographic keys

-   Share service instances between spaces or subaccounts

## Tools

You can access the *Credential Store* tile in the SAP BTP cockpit, in your Cloud Foundry or Kyma space.



## Technical Constraints

You can use only **1** service instance per space.

The following plans and metrics are available to you:

\*A **proxy** plan inherits the standard plan along with its metrics. Also, the proxy plan is only applied to scenarios that require service instance sharing. For more information, see: [Share, Unshare, and Authorize a Service Instance](admin-and-ops/share-unshare-and-authorize-a-service-instance-bcd0a59.md)

> ### Restriction:  
> If you create multiple proxy instances related to a single standard instance, then all these proxy instances together will be allowed to create up to 100,000 credentials. The same rule applies to all other metrics â€“ they can altogether make up to 25 calls per second, or bind up to 100 applications, and so on.
