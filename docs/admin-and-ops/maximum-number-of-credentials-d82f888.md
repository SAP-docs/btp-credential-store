## Prerequisites

-   You've created a service instance for SAP Alert Notification. See: [Initial Setup](https://help.sap.com/docs/alert-notification/sap-alert-notification-for-sap-btp/initial-setup?version=Cloud) â†’**Using the SAP BTP cockpit**
-   You've created a subscription to receive alerts for events. See: [Managing Subscriptions](https://help.sap.com/docs/alert-notification/sap-alert-notification-for-sap-btp/managing-subscriptions?version=Cloud)
-   You've created a service instance for SAP Credential Store. See: [Create a Service Instance](create-a-service-instance-dc5f087.md)

-   You've created one or more credentials in at least one namespace. See: [Create a Credential](create-edit-and-delete-a-credential-2a5423f.md)



## Context

To set up the threshold, you need to add a JSON configuration on a service instance level. This way, you'll start receiving notifications when the configured threshold for the number of created credentials per service instance has been reached.

Follow the steps below.



## Procedure

1.  From the left-side navigation menu, choose *Services* \> *Instances*.

2.  Select a *Credential Store* instance.

3.  Go to ![](images/Actions_62e6f79.png) \(*Actions*\) and choose *Update*.

4.  Choose *Next*.

5.  In the empty field, replace the default brackets `{}` with the following JSON code:

    > ### Example:  
    > ```
    > 
    > {
    > 	"notifications": {
    > 	"status": "enabled",
    > 	"credentials": {
    > 		"number-of-credentials-greater-than": 150
    >     }
    >   }
    > }
    > 
    > ```

    **Result:**

    According to this exemplary configuration, you will get a notification if you have created more than 150 credentials.

6.  Set the actual number of credentials according to your needs and service plan.

7.  Choose *Update Instance*.
