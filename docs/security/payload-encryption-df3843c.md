# Payload Encryption

SAP Credential Store allows payload encryption and thus ensures end-to-end confidentiality of the data transferred between the client and the server.

If this functionality is enabled, all request and response payloads have to be encrypted using the JWE compact serialization format. See: [JSON Web Encryption](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516) 

> ### Note:  
> This setting is **enabled** by default.
